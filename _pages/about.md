I am a research scientist in the [ASIPP](http://english.ipp.cas.cn/), short for institute of plamsa physics, Chinese Academic of Science. My research interests are about exploring the physic basis for tokamak advance scenarios, including the core transport , energetic particle , edge physics and the integration of them.
